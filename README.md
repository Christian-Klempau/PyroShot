# PyroShot

A multiplatform Screen Capture and annotation Tool, written in Flutter.

Inspired by Flameshot, built Linux first.

Distribution agnostic (Debian, Arch based)

Window compositor agnostic (X11, Wayland)

Desktop Environment agnostic (Gnome:gnome-screenshot, KDE:spectacle out of the box. Any other distro, if you install a common screen-grabber)

Wip:
- X11 support
- Wayland support
- Gnome support
- KDE support

ToDo (should work, just needs testing):
- Windows support
- MacOS support
